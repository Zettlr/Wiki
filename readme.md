> ZettlrWiki hasn't been updated in five years, and will not receive any updates.

***

ZettlrWiki is a minimal wiki system that combines the power to manage content
like a wiki and displays it neatly for maximum readability. It focuses on text
and navigability and on fast changing and creating pages. ZettlrWiki has been
designed with creative people and scientists in mind, who need to write down
their ideas or research results. Therefore it has been optimized for written
excerpts and thoughts and uses a smooth design, that enables a fast reading of
the content unlike the full-width design of most wiki systems that focus on
presenting a full board of information about very different topics.

## Features

ZettlrWiki has been designed minimally for maximum accessibility, to throw a lot
of content at it in a small amount of time. The features include:

* Markdown source instead of wikitext for maximum readability
* Create pages only with a title and a slug, keeping focus on content
* Easily edit pages and add your changes without having to struggle with
  revisions or discussion pages
* Always-accessible table of contents as a sidebar
* Full responsive design
* A page index, letting you identify orphaned pages or missing links that you've
  placed somewhere in a page
* Search engine

## Setup

Currently, there is no installer available for ZettlrWiki, so you have to
install it using composer. We will add a way to create a project using `composer
create-project zettlr/zettlrwiki` or something like that in the future.

## Contribution

We from Zettlr thankfully appreciate all of your ideas to make ZettlrWiki a
powerful personal wiki system for academics and writers as well as initiatives!
Just commit your proposals to this repository!
